# LauzHack motivation

In the midst of the COVID19 pandemic, which changed the world order as we
              know it, we can quickly get overwhelmed. With all the news, numbers and new
              measures taken by different governments, it's hard to get a clear understanding
              of the situation and to distinguish the truth.
              One can wonder if these measures can really help slow down the spread?
              If so at which rates do they have to be implemented to be effective? How do
              different measures add up ?
              
              
As students, we consider that the LauzHack is a great opportunity to put
              into practice concepts we learnt so far towards a good cause.To do so we are
              using mathematical models: in fact, they can give quite precise ideas of the
              situation and allow us to make relevant predictions.
              
              
Due to the lack of data on the current pandemic: we study general epidemics
              and try to analyse their spread. We allow the visitors to choose different values
              for parameters through an interactive platform. The different options will give
              a better interpretation on how different values lead to different spread rates and
              thus how strategies like confinement to different rates and social distancing for
              instance affect.
